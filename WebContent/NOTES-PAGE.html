TOPIC______________ Difference between Servlet and JSP:  

A servlet is a Java class which is used to extend the capabilities of servers that host applications accessed 
by means of a request-response model. Servlets are mainly used to extend the applications hosted by webs servers, 
however, they can respond to other types of requests too. For such applications, HTTP-specific servlet classes are 
defined by Java Servlet technology.  

A JSP is a text document which contains two types of text: static data and dynamic data. The static data can be 
expressed in any text-based format (like HTML, XML, SVG and WML), and the dynamic content can be expressed by JSP 
elements.

TOPIC______________ Session Object

By default, JSPs have session tracking enabled and a new HttpSession object is instantiated for each new client automatically. 
Disabling session tracking requires explicitly turning it off by setting the page directive session attribute to false as 
follows:

(angle bracket, percent, plus at sign) page session="false" %>

The JSP engine exposes the HttpSession object to the JSP author through the implicit session object. Since session object is 
already provided to the JSP programmer, the programmer can immediately begin storing and retrieving data from the object without 
any initialization or getSession().

Just thought it may be useful to somebody that keeps wondering where the session object comes from.

TOPIC______________ What is a pageContext Object in JSP:

The pageContext object is an instance of a javax.servlet.jsp.PageContext object. The pageContext object is used to 
represent the entire JSP page.

This object is intended as a means to access information about the page while avoiding most of the implementation details.

This object stores references to the request and response objects for each request. The application, config, session, and 
out objects are derived by accessing attributes of this object.

The pageContext object also contains information about the directives issued to the JSP page, including the buffering 
information, the errorPageURL, and page scope.

The PageContext class defines several fields, including PAGE_SCOPE, REQUEST_SCOPE, SESSION_SCOPE, and APPLICATION_SCOPE, 
which identify the four scopes. It also supports more than 40 methods, about half of which are inherited from the 
javax.servlet.jsp.JspContext class.

One of the important methods is removeAttribute. This method accepts either one or two arguments. For example, 
pageContext.removeAttribute ("attrName") removes the attribute from all scopes, while the following code only removes it from 
the page scope

pageContext.removeAttribute("attrName", PAGE_SCOPE);

TOPIC______________ Cookies

Functionality that is built into the browser.  Text data exchanged between web browser and server.

Keeps track of user preferences.  Allows you to personalize a web site for a user.  You can show them their preferences at a 
later time.  Ex. Expedia creates a cookie and stores it on the browser, user comes back to the site and the site has populated
the user's previous data entered.

Cookie - Contents:  
Name / value pair:  name myApp.favoriteProgrammingLanguage, value Java

Max is about 20 cookies per site, per path, but that is more than enough for most applications.

Cookies are passed:  browser will only send cookies that match the server's domain name!  browser won't send over cookies
that are not a match (helps with security).  

Browser, preferences, privacy, search cookies stored on your computer/ set in the browser

Cookies have an expiration time.

Cookie API Package:  
Cookie class defined in package: javax.servlet.http
Package imported for free in all JSP pages.

Cookie API Constructor:
Cookie(String name, String value) constructs a cookie with the specified name/value

Sending Cookies to Browser:
Create cookie, set life span.. total number of seconds, send cookie to browser

Retrieving cookies from Browser:

TOPIC______________ JSP Tags

Scenario:  Boss says we want to include a weather report in our JSP pages.

Option 1: use Scriptlets (bad practice, a lot of java code in JSP pages, mixing business code with presentation code,
also not reusable and maintainable)

// connect to remote weather service
// submit our weather request
// receive weather results
// parse the data: xml or json???
// display output in JSP page

Option 2: use JSP Custom Tags

JSP Custom Tags:
More heavy business logic into supporting classes
Insert JSP custom tag to use supporting class: example, drop this into JSP page: <demo:weatherReport city="Philidelphia"/>
The heavy lifting is in the back-end Java class.

JSP Standard Tag Library (JSTL):
Oracle created a Specification for standard tags that you can use on any projects.
Core tags: for handling variables, looping and conditionals.
XML tags: parsing and setting XML data.
Message Formatting (I18N): handling internationalization and formatting.
Functions: handling string manipulations, getting sizes of collections.
SQL: for accessing a database.  These in general are considered BAD practice.  Good for prototyping but not for RW production.
